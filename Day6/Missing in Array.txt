Given an array arr of size nâˆ’1 that contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to n (inclusive), find the missing element. The array is a permutation of size n with one element missing. Return the missing element.

Examples:

Input: n = 5, arr[] = [1,2,3,5]
Output: 4
Explanation : All the numbers from 1 to 5 are present except 4.



Solution:


class Solution {

    // Note that the size of the array is n-1
    int missingNumber(int n, int arr[]) {

        // Your Code Here
        int sum=n*(n+1)/2;
        int newsum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++){
            newsum=newsum+arr[i];
        }
        return sum-newsum;
}
}
