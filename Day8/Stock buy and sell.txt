The cost of stock on each day is given in an array A[] of size N. Find all the segments of days on which you buy and sell the stock such that the sum of difference between sell and buy prices is maximized. Each segment consists of indexes of two elements, first is index of day on which you buy stock and second is index of day on which you sell stock.
Note: Since there can be multiple solutions, the driver code will print 1 if your answer is correct, otherwise, it will return 0. In case there's no profit the driver code will print the string "No Profit" for a correct solution.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 7
A[] = {100,180,260,310,40,535,695}
Output:
1
Explanation:
One possible solution is (0 3) (4 6)
We can buy stock on day 0,
and sell it on 3rd day, which will 
give us maximum profit. Now, we buy 
stock on day 4 and sell it on day 6.

Soltion:

class Solution{
    //Function to find the days of buying and selling stock for max profit.
    ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer> > stockBuySell(int A[], int n) {
        // code here
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> profit=new ArrayList<>();
        int pro=0;
        int min=A[0];
        int minIndex=0;
        if(n<=1)
        return profit;
        for(int i=1;i<A.length;i++){
            ArrayList<Integer> l=new ArrayList<>();
            if(min<A[i]){
                l.add(minIndex);
                l.add(i);
                profit.add(l);
            }
            min=A[i];
            minIndex=i;
            
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
